## This is a room book implementation with React and Redux

- This project was built in with Create React App, you must install it globally

##Stacks and Libraries Used

##Approach the problem

- I started checking the API response to know the data format;
- I set one state to track if the user was pro or normal;
- I develop a component to handle room information;
- I develop a component to booking with fake data;
- I develop the form with validations, except to time validation;
- I developed a component to show the available times in a bar;
- I added a time picker to get the booking time

##TODO
- Validation for time to booking;
- Update available times on rooms state;
- Implement PRO time picker;
- Fixing Available Book Time style to mobile;
